Assuming the code has been checked out on the host PC please folllow the below steps.

WGT project can be imported into the TIZEN SDK as is.


wrt_src/wrt-plugins-tizen-emailplugin.pc.in  should go to

CmakeLists.txt contains all the 3 modules.This is common across all modules.
This can be takne as is as long as other 3 modules also part of the build.Or else 
We need to merge the chnages from this file into 
/prj/wrt-plugins-ivi/wrt-plugins-ivi-0.13.0/src/CmakeLists.txt

copy vcon.sh to anywhere int the target.

#Build steps on target:

cd /prj/wrt-plugins-ivi/wrt-plugins-ivi-0.13.0
cmake .
make
make install
cp -r /usr/local/lib/wrt-plugins/*  /usr/lib/wrt-plugins/
wrt-installer -p
wrt-installer -i Email.wgt

#launch followng daemons.Mostly you need to do zypper install.
